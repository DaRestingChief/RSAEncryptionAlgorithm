# RSAEncryptionAlgorithm
This project explains how the RSA encryption algorithm functions. It generates public and private keys, encrypts a message, and decrypts it back. RSA is based on prime numbers and modular mathematical operations to keep data safe. It is commonly used in online security, banks, and digital signatures.
